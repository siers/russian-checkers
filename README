- russian checkers, implemented in coffeescript

- description
    Written for amusement, initially for use within shoo.
    See the code for yourself.

- pitfalls
    The code's data stored in DOM, and not mirrored, so you can't currently 
    make the code work without browser or create standalone unittests.
    Also, the code's a bit too OOPed, which kind of sucks, I should've
    made it functional and recursive, where possible. I gave these issues
    a lot of thought and concluded that this code sucks without a refactor.
